		<h2> Test Content for GitHub Repo </h2>
		This is a simple html page. It is serving as initial content for my CS290 GitHub repository for Spring term 2016. Just for fun,
		I've added a picture of my dog to the page, her name is Dotti. :) <br />
		If this file is being read from GitHub, the url for this webpage is http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~christme/CS290/introductory_file.html.
